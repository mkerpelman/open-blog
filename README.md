# Open Blog

## Description
This project is the back-end of an "open blog" concept, a type of blog where any unauthenticated user can create, read, update, or delete any and all blog posts found on the website. While utterly useless in real life, building this twisted blog was an excellent way to practice doing things "the Rails way" per The Odin Project's [Blog App Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/ruby-on-rails-ruby-on-rails) brief, which is actually a code-along of the Rails Guides' [Getting Started With Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) tutorial with a little bit of a personal twist.
